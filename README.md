# **Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to classify retail customers into meaningful segments based on their purchasing behavior. By using unsupervised learning techniques, such as K-Means and DBSCAN clustering, the project enables retailers to better understand customer behavior and implement targeted marketing strategies. 

The approach includes the use of **RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary)** analysis to extract essential features, clustering methods to group similar customers, and visualization techniques to analyze and interpret the results.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Utilize a customer segmentation dataset (publicly available or provided).
   - Perform **RFM Analysis**:
     - **Recency**: Time since the customer's last purchase.
     - **Frequency**: Number of purchases made by the customer.
     - **Monetary**: Total spending by the customer.
   - Normalize the RFM features using **Min-Max Scaling** for better clustering performance.

2. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - **K-Means Clustering**:
     - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** .
   - **DBSCAN**:
     - Explore density-based clustering to identify core and noise points in the dataset.

3. **Visualization and Insights**:
   - Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., **PCA**) for 2D/3D visualization of clusters.
   - Detailed analysis of customer segments, identifying key characteristics for each group.
   - Suggestions for personalized marketing strategies based on cluster insights.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Clustering: `scikit-learn`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Dimensionality Reduction: `sklearn.decomposition`, `sklearn.manifold`

## **Usage**
1. Replace the dataset file (`customer_data.csv`) with your retail dataset.
2. Run the preprocessing and clustering scripts.
3. View the clusters and insights through generated visualizations.

## **Project Outputs**
- Processed RFM dataset with normalized features.
- Cluster assignments for each customer using K-Means and DBSCAN.
- Visualizations of customer clusters (2D/3D).
- Insights and recommendations for personalized marketing strategies.

## **Future Work**
- Incorporate additional features (e.g., customer demographics, product categories).
- Experiment with hierarchical clustering techniques.
- Develop a real-time dashboard for dynamic customer segmentation.
